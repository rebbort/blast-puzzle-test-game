This project contains a prototype for a Blast puzzle game. The badge above shows the status of the CI workflow which runs linting and type checking on every push to `main`.

## Running tests

Install dependencies once with `npm install` if needed, then run:

```bash
npm test
```

This executes the Jest suite defined in the `tests` folder.

## QA
