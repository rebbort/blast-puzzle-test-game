# Player Guide

## Game Rules and Objective
- Tap groups of two or more adjacent tiles of the same color to clear them.
- Each move removes the selected group and awards points based on its size.
- Larger groups create super tiles that can clear extra tiles when triggered.
- The goal of each level is to reach the target score before you run out of moves.

## Controls
- **Tap / Click** a tile group to remove it.
- **Select boosters** from the toolbar and then tap the board to apply them.
- **Super tiles** activate when tapped directly or when their group is cleared.

## Boosters
- **Teleport** – swap any two tiles on the board.
- **Bomb Maker** – converts a tile into a bomb that explodes in a 3×3 radius.
- **Super Row** – transforms a tile into a row-clearing super tile.
- **Super Column** – transforms a tile into a column-clearing super tile.

## Super Tiles
- **Bomb** – explodes in a small radius around the tile.
- **Row Blaster** – clears the entire row.
- **Column Blaster** – clears the entire column.
- **Board Clear** – removes all tiles on the board.

## Win, Loss, and Scoring
- You **win** when your score meets or exceeds the target before moves run out.
- You **lose** if you use all moves and no shuffles remain.
- The board automatically shuffles when no moves are left (limited times).
- Score is calculated with a quadratic formula: `(group size - 1)^2` points, encouraging big combos.
